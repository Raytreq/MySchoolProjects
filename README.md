# My school projects
### What is the purpose if this repository
I have made this repository in order to store a sizeable amount of all projects I made in secondary school(ZSEEiM in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça), though it is important to note that this is not the majority of all projects from my school, but these are surely the most important ones.
I want this repository to be somewhat of a representation of various work given to me by teachers during my education in a public school. Treat it like a showcase of what I did before I actually started using Git and this account. 

## How to navigate and use it
![what-huh](https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/assets/136091294/714c8d43-0748-453e-97f0-95152e452f0a)

###The repository consists of 5 main folders, mostly divided by school subjects:
*<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/bazyDanych">bazyDanych</a> *(All things related to learning databases)*
*<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/informatyka/klasa3">informatyka</a> *(General "computer science")*
*<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych/klasa3">programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych</a> *(Mobile applications)*
*<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiWebowych">programowanieAplikacjiWebowych</a> *(Web applications and development)*
*<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieObiektowe">programowanieObiektowe</a> *(Object-oriented programming)*

In each folder there are subfolders like for example "klasa4", because I sorted each subject into school years, "klasa**1**" being the **first** year, "klasa**2**" being the **second** year and so on.
Each school year folder contains specific projects.  

## Few things to note
***Yes, I know the repository is a bit of a mess, but that is not without a reason(Look at the languages tab for example). I wanted for it to be as practical as possible, so you would not need to download many packages or files need to run mobile apps. You can just download a folder and run the application locally as you normally would.**  
*"<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/informatyka/klasa3">informatyka</a>" and "<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych">programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych</a>" are the only folders consisting of one school year
*In "<a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiWebowych">programowanieAplikacjiWebowych</a>" there is a folder named "zadaniaDlaWychowawcy". Inside are projects given to me over all of the school years by my form tutor.

*Enjoy~*
