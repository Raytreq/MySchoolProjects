# My school projects
### What is the purpose of this repository
I have made this repository in order to store a sizeable amount of all projects I made in secondary school *(ZSEEiM in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça)*, though it is important to note that this is not the majority of all projects from my school, but these are surely the most important ones.
I want this repository to be somewhat of a representation of various work given to me by teachers during my education in a public school. Treat it like a showcase of what I did before I actually started using Git and this account. 

## How to navigate and use it
![what-huh](https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/assets/136091294/714c8d43-0748-453e-97f0-95152e452f0a)

### The repository consists of 5 main folders, each of them divided by school subjects:
* <a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/bazyDanych">bazyDanych</a> *(All things related to databases, i.e. SQL and PHP)*
* <a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/informatyka/klasa3">informatyka</a> *(General "computer science", i.e. Python)*
* <a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych/klasa3">programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych</a> *(Mobile applications in Xamarin)*
* <a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieAplikacjiWebowych">programowanieAplikacjiWebowych</a> *(Web applications and development, i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular)*
* <a href="https://github.com/Raytreq/MySchoolProjects/tree/main/programowanieObiektowe">programowanieObiektowe</a> *(Object-oriented programming in Python, C++, C#)*

In each folder there are subfolders like for example "klasa4", because I sorted each subject into school years, "klasa1" being the first year, "klasa2" being the second year and so on.
Each school year folder contains specific projects.

## Few things to note
* **Yes, I do know the repository is a bit of a mess(Look at the languages tab for example), but that is not without a reason. I wanted for it to be as practical as possible, so you would mostly not need to download any packages or files needed to run mobile apps. You can just download a folder from here and run the application locally as you would normally.**  
* "informatyka" and "programowanieAplikacjiMobilnych" are the only folders consisting of one school year
* In "programowanieAplikacjiWebowych" is a folder named "zadaniaDlaWychowawcy". Inside are projects given to me over all of the school years by my form tutor.
* Some applications may not run properly, because I didn't test them. If you encounter any errors please let me know, but bear in mind that some od these apps can just be poorly written and are not meant to work, that is because I wanted to show my progress in coding with this repo. 

*Enjoy~*
